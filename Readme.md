A repo for working on converting the Rosetta Code problem space into machine learning data for a training set.
Rosetta code is a programming chrestomathy with hundreds of task and algorithm types each expressed in several 
hundred different programming languages.

more data can be found here: https://github.com/ingydotnet/rosettacode-pm and here: https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code

you will have to gi clone https://github.com/acmeism/RosettaCodeData in order to have the data that makes any of the rcds*.py scripts run.
So far none of them have worked perfectly. I've only put about an hour into this with the help of ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot and Gemini.
I cycle through them giving each a chance and when they get hung up I ask them to restate the objective to improve the creation of the next attempt
which I then pass on to the next one. objective2.txt is the current version of the generated objective, it is actually an ongoing concetenation.
